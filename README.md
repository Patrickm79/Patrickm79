### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Patrick! I have a passion for workplace safety, my father and I were both injured on the river and that sparked a desire to improve safety through accessibility. I want to create products that are easy to use and will reduce accidents in the workplace.

You can find me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-millet-536110197/)
